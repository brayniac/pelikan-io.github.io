      A little background about myself: I've been working at Twitter since Nov
      2010, a really long time by Silicon Valley standards these days. All this
      time I've been working on cache, which allows me to touch pretty much
      every aspect of it – server, client, cluster management; and I've done
      pretty much every job possible – SRE, developer, architect, capacity
      planner, and manager.

      As anybody working on something long-term can attest, quality and joy
      matters in the long term, even just providing the same functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
      Take GPS for example – it's a modern technology that allows us to
      navigate with ease. However, it is only possible after we have incredibly
      accurate clocks (e.g. atomic clocks). Measuring time is something that's
      conceptually simple, and has been done for centuries. However, without
      improving the precision of such simple tasks, amazing modern technology
      like the GPS cannot happen.

      This is why I believe in the power of quality. I also believe in the power
      of storytelling. There are plenty of theories and principles on better
      design and code, but how do we apply them, what do they look like in real
      life?
      </p>
      <p>
      These can be best communicated via concrete examples, i.e. stories.

      Pelikan started from our desire to unify all the cache solutions used at
      Twitter. We've been using open-source software and their forks for years,
      including Memcached/Twemcache, Redis, and later developed other software
      such as Fatcache, Slimcache and Twemproxy.
      </p>
      <p>
      On the one hand, we recognize the great structural similarity in these
      services; on the other hand, we hesitate to introduce some of them and
      other new features into production, as we hesitate to support a plurality
      of codebases. We realize to make real progress, we have to consolidate and
      improve existing solutions, so we can avoid the maintenance baggage moving
      forward.

      Well, I have bad news for you – often enough, the answer is No. There are
      plenty of cases where "good" is good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
      People do not take their fanciest china to a picnic. Most scenarios do not
      warrant "better". Instead, before we try to make things better, "good" has
      to happen first. History does not wait for the perfect person or occasion
      to be created.

      Timing is important. For example, Twitter infrastructure in general went
      through stages: first we used available tech that worked, then went on to
      patch and fork, eventually we had enough experiences and resources to
      reconsider our problems and solutions from first principles. We could not
      have made the kind of improvements that are happening now 5 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
      One tool that has been repeatedly used to assess projects is the 2x2 risk
      matrix by Ryan King (an ex-Tweep): it compares the status quo and the
      goal of a project. Generally, we want gradual improvement, and avoid
      aiming for perfection when having nothing. The motto is "evolution, not
      revolution".

      Achieving "better" requires careful evalution. Is our effort better spent
      on creating “something new”, or “something better”?
      If we think it is more beneficial to improve something that already
      exists, do we understand concretely the weakness and strength of existing
      solutions, and therefore what will make it stronger?
      Do we know the technical solution that addresses those weaknesses? How
      much resources would it take to implement?
      </p>
      <p>
      These questions need to be repeatedly asked, until we are honestly
      confident about our answers. For Pelikan, the amount of time since its
      inception and the amount of political capital it cost showed how difficult
      it can be to justify betterment.

      So now the project is on. How do we make sure the execution meets the
      goals?

      <p>
      I would argue that skillfulness alone does not guarantee better solution.
      Often, one also needs to have a better understanding of <em>the problem</em>.
      Insight and skills are the two necessary ingredents to achieve better
      design and code.

      In 1950s, there was a popular show called The $64,000 Question. Good
      questions are incredibly valuable. What's more, they stand the test of
      time much better than answers. Today, we often use a slightly different
      version of the phrase, "the million dollar question". So the value of
      a good question not only tracks inflation in the US since the 50s –
      which is about 10x – it even beats it.

      For Pelikan, we set out to ask a set of questions related to cache. These
      are good questions coming out of our years of operations and working
      closely with our customers (which register at more than 100 internally).
      There is only one problem: these questions are impossible to answer.
      </p>
      <p>
      Take the first question for example: caching is so ubiquitous – it is used
      for CPU, in CDNs and just about every other system, how can we
      characterize caching for our project?

      As it turns out, constraints are our friend. We cannot build a cache for
      everybody and everything, but we can build a good cache for <em>something</em>.

      Look at the four images on this page. All of them can be described by one
      word – a farm. But look how vastly different they are depending on their
      context!
      </p>
      <p>
      By having a narrow(er), well-defined context, it is much easier to
      understand and clarify design goals and limitations. This leads to more
      robust system that is less likely to be misused. Making fundamental
      assumptions explicit also reminds us to re-assess when the underlying
      context changes over time.

      So we rewrote the questions for the specific context that we care about,
      which made them a lot easier to answer.

      <p>
      By looking closely at the underlying infrastructure and our use cases, we
      were able to clear some myth previously held as truth: for example, while
      it is often advantageous to host data purely in memory, under certain
      circumstances it's perfectly fine to use non-volatile storage for caching.

      We summarize our insight into the problem as a concrete goal: when we say
      we want to build a better cache, we mean we want build a production-ready

      Interface or indirection is probably the most important concept in
      building systems. David Wheeler has the saying, "Any problem in computer
      science can be solved with another layer of indirection".
      </p>
      <p>
      We inevitably create interfaces while building software – unless your
      entire service is a single giant function, you are creating interfaces
      whether trying or not. So really the emphasis here is on “well-groomed”.
      </p>
      <p>
      In practice, the only way to achieve this is to make defining interfaces
      an explicit exercise, and revise them along the way.

      The modules of Pelikan were created before implementation started, and
      modified many times as we flesh out implementation. It was certainly
      helpful in identifying the parts, and reasoning about the relationships
      between them.

      A concept closely related to interface is abstraction. When do we need
      it? How can we avoid over- or under- applying abstraction?
      </p>
      <p>
      In the 90s, the Olson twins starred in a show called Two Of A Kind, that
      succinctly describes the principle of abstraction – create an abstraction
      if and only if there are at least two different things of the same kind.
      Don't bother when there is only one. On the other hand, if there are two,
      chances are one can come up with a more or less proper abstraction by
      looking at these instances at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
      Pelikan is filled with such examples: protocol abstraction is created by
      looking at Ping, Memcached and Redis protocols. Channel is defined by
      summarizing TCP/UDP connections, Unix Domain Socket, and pipes. Some of
      them are not yet implemented, but we put them through the thought process
      to make sure the abstraction covers them.

      There is often a tension between building a small set of features quickly,
      and implementing them in a way that doesn't require rewrite in the future.
      How can we know we are on the right track without implementing everything
      upfront?
      </p>
      <p>
      The aforementioned thought exercise with potential features is helpful for
      building a maintainable framework. Often times, just think about how
      something new could be implemented given the existing abstractions and
      interfaces is enough to prevent us from making decisions that will
      <em>certainly</em> make things hard or impossible down the road.
      Minimizing such decisions yields a more maintainable code base.

      Layering is one of the most powerful concept leading to the explosion of
      software. We all stand on the shoulders of giants. But sometimes, that
      shoulder patch can be a little slippery.
      A Lego tower like this is not possible if all the pieces have smooth
      surfaces. Writing good software is similar – we want different layers to
      have good grip between them, not simply piling bricks on top of one other.
      </p>
      <p>
      Abstraction is here to help break down complex problems / systems, not to
      calcify the modules. Making a change at one level often means making
      changes at other levels as well. For example, when writing Pelikan server
      we noticed the same sequence of buffer-related functions being called
      repleatedly, therefore we added a new function to the buffer interface to
      simplify such cases. In another case, we realized using the previous timer
      interface makes object life-cycle management difficult for one-off timers,
      and decided to change the corresponding timing wheel interface.

      "God is in the detail", and the only way to get a glimpse of God is
      through rigor. Just like system security depends on the weakest link,
      achieving design goals hinges on the part that is least carefully
      implemented.

      For example, with Twemcache, we had to disable logging beyond the ERROR
      level in production, because it directly calls `write()` which occasional
      requires flushing to disk. Rarely but eventually, such activity slows
      down the main thread when another unrelated background task creates
      contention at the disk, which is beyond our control. Logging is something
      developers rarely give a second thought about, and yet to achieve
      deterministic runtime, we had to completely change how logging is
      implemented in Pelikan. We made similar effort for metrics recording and
      the use of `malloc()` as well.

      Rigor also means spending a lot of time thinking about corner cases. A lot
      of states in distributed systems are hard to produce with simple unit test.
      In practice, people often resort to using “battle-tested” systems whose
      states are more thoroughly explored, even just by chance. If one wants to
      build a more robust solution from the beginning, they have to carefully
      reason about the problem in an exhausitve way – Margaret Hamilton did not
      have the chance to "battle-test" her team's software for Project Apollo,
      instead, they foresaw what might go wrong.

      On top of that, it would be great if formal proof is more widely used to
      verify the correctness of a system. Developers should make debugging
      info a first-class citizen, because things inevitable go wrong.

      Details also means paying attention to seemingly frivolous things, such as
      names. You'd be surprised by the amount of time we spent arguing about
      names. But after being in meetings where people try to correct each other
      every five minutes because they had slightly different interpretation of
      the same name, I would like to argue that agreeing on definition is much
      more than just bike-shedding, but the cornerstone of collaboration.

      Good style should be obvious, consistent, and simple. It is hard to notice
      that when things are done right, just like one would not pay attention to
      the ground underneath unless there is a bump that trips us. Instead, it is
      much easier to give examples when things are not quite right.

      On the right column is the entire setup of all modules used by Pelikan's
      Twemcache server in `main()`. It is fairly plain and uninteresting. On the

      Another powerful style element is the presence of universal rules. An

      The two blocks of code on this page are for setting up module
      configuration and metrics, respectively. Despite providing different
      functionalities, they have similar shapes and patterns. A closer
      examination reveal the reason behind it – at a meta level, configuration
      is how a service builder gives input to various modules, while metrics are
      how a service builder gathers output about the internal states of the same
      modules. The symmetry in form reflects the deeper symmetry in their
      purposes. Code like this can be called beautiful, for it surfaces the
      underlying truth.

      One answer is never to underestimate the power of prototypes. We were able
      to do better, because we learned from previous experiences. To continue to
      produce better design and code, we need to gain similar experiences even
      with new features.

      I worked on Twemcache for 2 years without understanding how event loops
      worked . When working on Pelikan, I had to learn about epoll and kqeuue
      from scratch, making many mistakes in the process. Later on, in a separate
      project, I proposed how to abstract event handling with a set of
      interfaces, and got increasingly frustrated when nobody in the room seemed
      to know what I was talking about after hours of meetings. Then I realized
      that nobody else in the room had implemented event loops before, just like
      how I started. So I suggested everybody go home and write a throw-away
      prototype echo server, just to get some intuitive understanding of the
      details. The group reconvenened the following week, and amazingly, the
      discussion flowed smoothly, and we were able to reach an agreement and
      moved on with the design.
      </p>
      <p>
      The same practice should be used whenever working on something new, even
      within an established codebase. First make it work, and learn from that
      process. Only then we can make sure the final version is better.

      A common myth in software development is insisting reusing existing code.
      If I can get a dollar for everytime someone asks me why I don't just use
      X/Y/Z, I'd be eating at some very fancy restaurant tonight.
      </p>
      <p>
      Granted, there's nothing wrong with using existing code. The problem is
      code reuse is not a binary decision, it is a continuum. It goes anywhere
      from just borrowing the idea, to wholesale adoption. It is the developer's
      job to decide where on the spectrum their project falls.
      </p>
      <p>
      Code reuse is often "awkward" because existing code can be "slightly off"
      in terms of functionality and (more likely) style. In practice, what we
      did with Pelikan is to broadly survey related projects, shamelessly copy
      and paste code that fits into our design, and relentlessly edit them
      afterwards. We started out with about 50 percent old code from existing
      implementations, but over time have made changes to them as if they were
      our own. As a result, the project feels consistent, and we were able to
      avoid writing brand-new logic especially for the high-risk portion of the
      design.

      If we want a project to stay "better", we need to remember that nothing is

      In the past few years I’ve never met a feature that took more than a day
      to implement, and that is entirely deliberate. Once I realized a feature
      would take longer than a day, I started asking if it is due to some design
      misfit or architectural shortcoming. And often enough, it is. So a new
      feature becomes refactoring – the interface may need modification, or the
      modules need to be restructured, or an abstraction requires re-visiting.
      After spending days doing that and changing 1000+ lines of code, at the
      end I could add the feature with just a small amount of additional effort.

      Here's what a code base with frequent refactoring looks like – there

      around updating existing code, reflected in almost as much deletion as
      there is addition in git history.

      Some amount of doubt is perfectly normal. Competition motivates us to do
      better. But one needs to handle it with a healthy dose of awareness:
      knowing where things overlap, knowing one's strength and weaknesses, and

      In the end, there really is no guarantee that any single project we build
      will “take off”. And this includes Pelikan. So why are we still doing
      this? Why putting so much effort into <em>trying</em> to make something
      better?

      Because practice is the only way to gain true mastery. That experience
