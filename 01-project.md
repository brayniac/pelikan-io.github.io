[Pelikan](https://github.com/twitter/pelikan) is a cache framework written in C.
It provides an expanding collection of cache services, and a common library,
[ccommon](https://github.com/twitter/ccommon), used to build them.

Pelikan optimizes for high-throughput, low-latency data access in a
datacenter-like environment. It adopts a highly modularized architecture,
and is carefully implemented to achieve high-performance and reliability
at scale. Its design captures much of the commonality among similar
systems, such as Memcached, Redis and Twemproxy, and makes improving and
iterating on such services easier and faster.

### Products

Currently Pelikan yields three production-ready products, all of which are
backends/servers.

* `pelikan_twemcache`: a Twemcache replacement
* `pelikan_slimcache`: a Memcached-like server with ultra-low memory overhead-
  compared to Memcached/Redis, the per-key overhead is reduced by up to 90%
* `pelikan_pingserver`: an over-engineered ping server useful
  as a tutorial and for measuring baseline RPC performance
